# RoomHandlers DDD Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) refactoring of RoomHandlers.ts, detailing what functionality remains in the coordination layer versus what has been moved to domain-specific handlers.

## Architecture Principles

RoomHandlers now follows DDD best practices by serving as a **coordination layer** that:

1. **Delegates** domain-specific operations to appropriate domain handlers
2. **Coordinates** cross-domain interactions when needed
3. **Manages** HTTP endpoints and basic socket coordination
4. **Does NOT contain** business logic (that belongs in domain handlers)

## Functionality Distribution

### What STAYS in RoomHandlers (Coordination Layer)

#### HTTP Endpoints
- `getHealthCheck()` - System health monitoring
- `getRoomList()` - Basic room listing
- `handleCreateRoomHttp()` - Delegates to RoomLifecycleHandler
- `handleLeaveRoomHttp()` - Delegates to RoomLifecycleHandler

#### Cross-Domain Coordination
- `handleDisconnect()` - Coordinates between approval workflow and room lifecycle
- `getOrCreateRoomNamespace()` - Namespace management utility
- Basic socket session management coordination

#### Delegation Methods
- `handleTransferOwnership()` - Delegates to RoomMembershipHandler
- `handleTransferOwnershipNamespace()` - Delegates to RoomMembershipHandler
- `handleJoinRoomNamespace()` - Delegates to RoomLifecycleHandler

### What MOVED to Domain Handlers

#### Room Management Domain (`domains/room-management/`)

**RoomLifecycleHandler**
- Room creation logic
- Room joining logic  
- Room leaving logic
- Room state management
- User onboarding coordination

**RoomMembershipHandler**
- Member approval/rejection
- Ownership transfer business logic
- Member state management
- Pending member handling

**MetronomeHandler**
- Metronome state updates
- Metronome synchronization
- Tempo coordination

#### Audio Processing Domain (`domains/audio-processing/`)

**AudioRoutingHandler**
- Synth parameter updates
- Audio bus routing
- Effect chain management
- Audio state coordination

**NotePlayingHandler**
- Note playing events
- Instrument changes
- Note stopping logic
- Musical event coordination

#### Real-time Communication Domain (`domains/real-time-communication/`)

**VoiceConnectionHandler**
- WebRTC connection management
- Voice offer/answer handling
- ICE candidate exchange
- Voice mesh coordination

**ChatHandler**
- Chat message broadcasting
- Message validation
- Chat state management

#### User Management Domain (`domains/user-management/`)

**ApprovalWorkflowHandler**
- Private room approval workflows
- Approval request handling
- Approval timeout management
- Approval session coordination

## Domain Handler Dependencies

Each domain handler is injected into RoomHandlers constructor:

```typescript
constructor(
  private roomService: RoomService,
  private namespaceManager: NamespaceManager,
  private roomSessionManager: RoomSessionManager,
  private roomLifecycleHandler: RoomLifecycleHandler,
  private roomMembershipHandler: RoomMembershipHandler,
  private approvalWorkflowHandler: ApprovalWorkflowHandler
) {}
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each handler has a focused, single responsibility
- Business logic is contained within appropriate domain boundaries
- Coordination logic is separated from business logic

### 2. Maintainability
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced file size (RoomHandlers.ts reduced from 1000+ lines to ~200 lines)

### 3. Testability
- Domain handlers can be tested in isolation
- Coordination logic can be tested separately
- Easier to mock dependencies

### 4. Extensibility
- New features can be added to appropriate domain handlers
- Cross-domain features can be coordinated through RoomHandlers
- Clear patterns for future development

## Migration Validation

### Requirements Satisfied

- **4.1**: Service layer restructuring with focused handlers
- **4.6**: Clean separation of concerns and proper dependency injection
- **7.3**: Backward compatibility maintained through delegation
- **11.1**: Legacy code systematically removed and organized

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Each domain handler tested independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-domain coordination tested through RoomHandlers
3. **Regression Tests**: Existing functionality verified through delegation
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no degradation from additional abstraction layer

## Future Considerations

### Adding New Features

1. **Domain-Specific Features**: Add to appropriate domain handler
2. **Cross-Domain Features**: Coordinate through RoomHandlers
3. **New Domains**: Create new domain structure and integrate through RoomHandlers

### Monitoring and Observability

- Each domain handler includes logging for traceability
- Error handling maintains context about which domain failed
- Performance monitoring can track domain-specific metrics

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully transforms RoomHandlers from a monolithic handler into a clean coordination layer that delegates to domain-specific handlers. The architecture now follows DDD principles while maintaining backward compatibility and improving maintainability.
